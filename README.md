# r-explore


## Folder gettingstarted

This folder contains an example of how to setup a simple R project for package development, running unit tests using testthat package, and to develop the project in RStudio

The files were generated using the devtools::create() method, and hand edited later

But you can use this as a template for new R projects if you like
